		<h2>History of the Chihuahua.</h2>
		<p>The Chihuahuas are descendants from the Techichi, a companion dog favored by the Toltec civilization in Mexico. Wheeled dog toys representing both the "deer head" and "apple head" varieties of Chihuahua have been unearthed across Mesoamerica from Mexico to El Salvador. The earliest of these were found at Tres Zapotes in Veracruz, Mexico, which date to 100 AD, evidence that the breed was in Mexico over 1400 years before the first Europeans arrived. Dog effigy pots dating to around 1325 AD discovered in Georgia and Tennessee also appear to represent the Chihuahua. In 1850, a pot featuring the "deer head" variety of Chihuahua was unearthed in old ruins at Casas Grandes in the Mexican state of Chihuahua.</p>

		<h3>Diffrent Types of Chihuahuas.</h3>
		<p>There are two varieties of Chihuahua â€“ the Smooth Coat (short haired) and the Long Coat. The UK Kennel Club considers smooth and long coated Chihuahuas two distinct breeds. Dogs of either coat type may be identified as either "apple head" or "deer head" Chihuahuas. Apple heads have rounded heads, close-set eyes, and relatively short ears and legs. Deer heads have flat-topped heads, more widely set eyes, larger ears, and longer, more slender legs. While deer heads were popular in the mid-twentieth century, current breed standards defined by registries such as the Chihuahua Club of America and American Kennel Club specify the apple head conformation. </p>
